# Cédric Belin's Card
Business card of Cédric Belin, yet another full stack developer,
addicted to [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com)/[C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp)/[PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell),
but also to [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript)/[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org),
[Haxe](https://haxe.org) and [PHP](https://www.php.net).

## Usage
Before you start, you need to make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) up and running.
You can verify if you're already good to go with the following command:

```shell
node --version
```

Then, to display the business card, just type the following command in your terminal:

```shell
npx @cedx/card
```

And voila!
