Business card of Cédric Belin, yet another full stack developer,
addicted to [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org),
but also to [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp), [Haxe](https://haxe.org) and [PHP](https://www.php.net).

## Usage
Before you start, you need to make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) up and running.
You can verify if you're already good to go with the following command:

```shell
node --version
# v23.6.1
```

Then, to display the business card, just type the following command in your terminal:

```shell
npx @cedx/card
```

And voila!
